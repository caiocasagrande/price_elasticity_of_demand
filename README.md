## Overview 
The dataset contains multiple data from many brands, categories and merchants, but through an exploratory data analysis it was decided that price elasticity would be calculated for the best-selling category of the merchant with the most sales made in the year.
So, in this fictional project, I aim to explore the price elasticity of demand for laptops and computers. 

## Tabs
- Exploratory Data Analysis - Hypotheses, questions and insights for the project.
- Price Elasticity - Price elasticity results.
- Business Performance - The monetary results of the analysis for the company.
- Crossed Elasticity - Crossed elasticity between all products

### Goals
Faced with a scarcity of real-world data, my investigation delves into a hypothetical retail environment. The goal is to understand how price variations impact consumer demand for these products, despite limited data availability. 

### How does it work?
The analysis employs fundamental principles of price elasticity to uncover insights that could drive strategic decision-making.

### What is its importance for a company?
This project demonstrates the importance of economic modeling and data science in a fictional scenario, offering a brief look into the potential value of such analysis for businesses operating in the real world.
