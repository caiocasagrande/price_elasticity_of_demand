    In this fictional project, I aim to explore the price elasticity of demand for laptops and computers. 
    
    Faced with a scarcity of real-world data, my investigation delves into a hypothetical retail environment. 
    The goal is to understand how price variations impact consumer demand for these products, despite limited data availability. 
    The analysis employs fundamental principles of price elasticity to uncover insights that could drive strategic decision-making. 
    
    This project demonstrates the importance of economic modeling and data science in a fictional scenario, offering a brief look into the potential value of such analysis for businesses operating in the real world.
